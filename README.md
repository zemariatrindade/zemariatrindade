👨‍💻 Data Projects I've Made:
Customer leads creation for travel agencies
In this project, I assisted Outbound Sales teams in Travel Agencies by identifying potential customer leads on social media and providing tailored flight and accommodation options based on their activity on Reddit. Used: Python, ETL Pipeline, SQLite database, spaCy NLP library, web scraping.

Detecting Covid in X-rays images
Applied supervised ML techniques using TensorFlow Keras API NN to detect covid in 224x224 x-ray chest images.
